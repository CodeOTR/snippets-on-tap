# Code on the Rocks

[Code on the Rocks](https://cotr.dev/) is a social network for developers. We provide tools to create, share, edit, and admire code snippets. 

# COTR Snippets

If you use VS Code, you can install the [cotr-snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeontheRocks.cotr-snippets) extension to easily save code snippets from your IDE.

# Snippets on Tap

This repository is updated weekly with all of the snippets stored in the Code on the Rocks database. Each snippet has a title, a description, tags, and a link to the Code on the Rocks website where you can capture screenshots or remix them.
